Music-Sharing Application (Full-Stack, Python, JavaScript, React, GraphQL, Django)

• Developed a full-stack music-sharing application with React and Python for users to upload and share music, interact with music
tracks by searching, liking, and adding, and collaborate with music information by adding, editing, and deleting.
